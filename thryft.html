                <h1>Thryft</h1>
                <p class="duration" >2014 JULY - PRESENT</p>

                

                <p>Thryft is a small side project I've been working on with two friends. I lead discussions regarding the user experience, design the end-to-end UX flow for our users, generate high-fidelity visual mock-ups, and tackle pretty much anything else under the UX/visual/design/creative umbrella. It's awesome! I'm also using this project as an excuse to learn Objective-C (sorry Swift) and improve my iOS dev capabilities.</p>

        		<p>Some tools I've used on this project so far:
        			<ul class="double">
        				<li>Experience diagramming</li>
        				<li>Adobe CS6</li>
        				<li>Sketch 3</li>
        			</ul>
                    <ul class="double">
                        <li>Xcode</li>
                        <li>Wireframes</li>
                        <li>Thumbnail sketches</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <div id="wrapper" class="full-width">
                    <img class=" mobile-screenshot" src="images/thryft/explore.png"/>
                    <img class=" mobile-screenshot" src="images/thryft/notifications.jpg" />
                    <p class="wrapper-caption">Final designs of the explore pane (left) and the notifications pane (right).

                <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                <p><p class="section-heading">THE IDEA</p>
                    Thryft is a way for people to buy and sell objects they don't want with people around them. We wanted to help people realize the value lying around them by building an easy way to share items with neighbors.
                </p>

                <div id="wrapper" class="">
                    <img class="full-image" src="images/thryft/logo-explorations.png" />
                    <p class="wrapper-caption">Brand explorations around Thryft's identity, including logo and icon</p>
                </div>

                <p><p class="section-heading">KEY FUNCTIONS</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users should have the ability to easily and quickly list an item from their mobile device</li>
                        <li>Users should have the ability to browse nearby listings and swipe through high-quality photos</li>
                        <li>Thryft should act as the middle-man, removing any ambiguity from buying and selling items with people you don't know</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                 
                <h3>UX Design</h3>
                <p>
                To understand how a user will move through our app, I created a master UX flowchart that we've been able to revisit and refine continually. Moreover, this really pushed the team to think through and agree on the nuances of the UX, rather than leave things as broader generalizations. 
                </p>

                <div id="wrapper">
                    <img style="border: 1px solid #cecece;"class="full-image" src="images/thryft/ux-flow.jpg"/>
                    <p class="wrapper-caption">A small cutout of the master UX flowchart</p>
                </div>
                <p>When creating this flow chart, I built outward from five key interaction areas within the app:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Explore (i.e. "Thryft")</li>
                        <li>Search</li>
                        <li>Sell</li>
                        <li>Notifications</li>
                        <li>Profile</li>
                    </ul>
                You can view the entirety of the flow chart <a href="images/thryft/thryft-ux-flow.pdf">here</a>. 
                </p>

                <p><p class="section-heading">WIREFRAMES</p>
                I used wireframes to prototype many of the key user flows. These were useful in determining the general layout of the app, placement of various interface elements, and copy.</p>

                <h3>Visual Design</h3>

                <p>After laying out the overall structure, clarifying the primary uses of the app, and working through the various UX flows, I moved on to the visual design. I started with the five core screens I emphasized when creating the master UX flowchart. 
                <div id="wrapper">
                    <img class="mobile-screenshot" src="images/thryft/profile-grid.jpg" />
                    <img class="mobile-screenshot" src="images/thryft/profile-list.jpg" />
                    <p class="wrapper-caption">Two different treatments for the profile pane: grid view vs. list view</p>
                </div>
                <p class="section-heading">MY STRATEGY</p><p>
                     I see visual design as another exciting opportunity to problem solve. Currently, my approach involves breaking a layout down into its smallest components and assembling them into progressively larger groups. This allows me to create a sense of order at a small scale through subsets and, then, to combine these subsets into larger layouts. For example, in the profile pane above, one mid-sized component is the top block containing the profile photo, name, and other info. A subcomponent of this block is the seller rating block, while a parent component is the main body of the layout.
                </p>

                <div id='wrapper'>
                    <img class="mobile-screenshot" src="images/thryft/explore.png" />
                    <img class="mobile-screenshot" src="images/thryft/card-view.jpg" />
                    <p class="wrapper-caption">Users select categories of items they wish to browse (above, left)</br>Browse nearby items through a swipe interaction (above, right) - "Nay" and "Yay" actions feel casual and non-commital</p>
                </div>

                <p><p class="section-heading">HOW DO WE WANT THEM TO FEEL?</p>
                This is a question I come back to again and again on any project. In many ways, it's the most important question for me to answer when designing for an individual. What does it feel like when someone thryfts? As a team, we settled on feelings of delight, casualness, trustworthiness, and effortlessness. The two-tone color scheme lets me appropriately place emphasis to guide the user, the use of real identities contributes to trustworthiness, and the play on words in "Nay" and imagery in "Yay" ensure people don't feel too serious when browsing items. 

                <h3>A Work-in-Progress</h3>
                <p>We're still chugging along on this side project, but have taken a bit of a hiatus to focus on work and other commitments. More to come sometime soon - feel free to ping me if you're curious!</p>
