                <h1>Nextdoor Polls</h1>
                <p class="duration" >2014 JULY - PRESENT</p>

                <p>I worked with a front-end engineer, two backend engineers, and a project manager to conceive, prototype, test, and build a new feature that would allow users to poll neighbors and gather insights about their community. </p>

                <div>&nbsp;</div>
                <h3>Why polls?</h3>
                <p>
                    A simple polling ability has been the number one requested feature by our users over the past two years.
                </p>
                <h3>User interviews</h3>
                <p>
                	I led informal interviews with 4 leads who had requested the polls feature. For these interviews, I created and used the following prompts:</p>
                	<ul>
                	<li>Tell me about a time you asked your neighborhood a question.</li>
                	<li>Tell me about a time you've used Nextdoor to make a decision about your neighborhood.</li>
					<li>Do you think other leads would use a polling ability? Why or why not?</li>
                	<li>If there was a polling feature, what types of questions would neighbors ask?</li>
                	</ul>
                <p>Below I've collected a handful of the memorable quotes from these conversations:
                <ul >
                <li>"There was this giant fence that fell over on Cowdray Court. It backed right up to a park and I wanted to know if people thought we should remove it, or replace it."</li>
                <li>"Our neighborhood boundaries were crazy so I asked neighbors how they thought we should change them."</li>
                <li>"I remember a lead from a nearby neighborhood who seemed like she had a really great pulse on her neighborhood. I think I could use this to figure out what my neighbors are thinking too."</li>
                <li>"I bet you'd get a lot of questions about coffee shops or bakeries. Ya know places around town. Like, what's the best cup of coffee or where's the best place to buy a hammer - stuff like that."</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                	I shared the quotes with the team and explained a few insights that I took away:
                	<ul>
                		<li>This project is all about questions. Our users - be they neighbors or leads - have a wealth of questions they could be asking their neighbors, but we don't prompt them to do so.</li>
                		<li>Leads want to understand how neighbors think and feel about a particular issue, like boundary changes or speed-bumps and stop-signs.</li>
                		<li>Our users will likely treat this as a tool that can be used, rather than a means of asking casual questions. All the examples involve the acquisition of information through questions.</li>
                	</ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Defining the "Minimal Lovable Product"</h3>
                <p>
                	We used the feature requests and user interviews to create the following point of view: Nextdoor leads<strong> need </strong>to ask their neighborhood questions<strong> because </strong>it allows them to understand how their community thinks and feels.
                </p>
                <p>This allowed us to eliminate a lot of bells and whistles that weren't vital for the first version, such as:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Including "Add other: ________" as a poll option</li>
                <li>The ability to select multiple answers to a question</li>
                <li>Excessive visualization of the poll results</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Additionally, it let us decide on key features of our first version of polls:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Support inputs for one question, an optional poll description, and up to 10 answer choices limited to 50 characters to limit the number of lines that will wrap</li>
                <li>Users may vote on only one option to avoid over-designing a feature before we test it</li>
                <li>Give users the ability to view results without voting, so everyone can participate in the conversation of the results</li>
                <li>Give poll creators the ability to close a poll, so we can notify participants of the "results" and communicate a sense of finality</li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Designing the polls feature</h3>
                <p>The Nextdoor newsfeed consists of one of three types of posts: messages, events, and urgent alerts. Polls would be a new, fourth type of post. Thus, it was important that poll creation, voting, and viewing was possible on the web, iOS, and Android. Users should also see polls in their email digests and alerts. I was responsible for designing the polls experience across all these mediums. I looked at SurveyMonkey and Google Docs to see how they did it. I looked at Facebook, who supported polls at one point but has since removed the feature.</p>

                <h3>Measuring success</h3>
                <p>We'll be testing the polls feature in the next month or so. Meaningful metrics will take some time to gather; however, I'm looking forward to seeing the following numbers:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Percentage of neighborhoods with at least one poll posted within the first month</li>
                <li>Percentage of users who click on the polls tab to understand how many users are discovering this additional post type</li>
                <li>Percentage of neighbors that answer a poll to understand participation</li>
                <li>Average number of times a poll "bubbles up" in the newsfeed to gauge popularity and user engagement with the post type</li>
                <li>Average number of replies to a poll to see if they spark more conversation than an ordinary post</li>
                </ul>
